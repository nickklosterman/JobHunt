\citem{Research  Assistant}, Purdue University  August 2007 - July 2010 
\begin{itemize}
%PRIME
\item Updated weather visualization software with requested features from Purdue University's Earth \& Atmospheric Sciences faculty.
\item Implemented data color coding to allow for easier analysis of convection paths in simulation datasets.
\item Implemented pop-up of 2D image slice of selected convection path. %this seems a bit lame...too specific?
%education module
\item Co-developed education module that discussed pros, cons, and pitfalls associated with various software visualization techniques.
\item Presented education module to Indiana Teachers as part of a workshop emphasizing computer visualization in the classroom.
\item Presented Google Maps visualization exercise to Indiana High School students. The exercise demonstrated the geographic effect of a terrorist act in an urban and rural setting as part of a Homeland Security class.
