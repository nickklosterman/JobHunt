Don't just say fuck it and take a job. Think how long you'd want to stay there or even if you'd want to stay there.
Your reasons for the job should weigh the money  aspect less (all things being equal) and the desirability of the job/work should be high.
Look towards skills that you will gain in the position in thxe long run.
Always work with people smarter than you so that you can learn and gain skills.
Look at jobs that request the skills that you'll be growing in the new position. What are the prospects for jobs for those new skills? What back up skills will you need to work on so that you have a viable skill set as a back up plan?
