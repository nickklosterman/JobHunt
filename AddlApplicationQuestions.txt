Relate how your work/education experience relates to performance demanded of this job.

I have direct work experience writing test software to automate product testing.  In this capability I also developed software to automate report generation with statistical analysis of product performance.
I am versed in several programming languages (C++, Java, LabVIEW, Visual Basic), scripting languages(Bash, Python, php), and analysis tools (Octave, Matlab) to perform the desired work to a high level.

Career Objectives:
I'm an electrical engineer searching for a position in product development or manufacturing where I can utilize my software skills for product performance analysis, testing, and evaluation.

Do you have a strong engineering and computerized systems attitude? If so provide an example.

My engineering background has provided me with a variety of tools to collect, interpret and analyze data in an efficient manner. 
I currently use C++, Java, python, php, MySQL, GNUplot and various other open source tools to accomplish tasks spanning my projects that run the gamut of financial analysis to foreclosure mapping.
I use C++, Java, and python for data analysis and retrieval.  MySQL is used for collecting and keeping data in an organized manner. I use GNUplot for generating plots on the fly of various parameters from data stored in the MySQL database.
My foreclosure mapping project utilizes python to analyxe foreclosure listings, geocode (translate addresses into latitude/longitude coordinates) them, and enter the data into the database.  I then use php and the Google Maps API to plot the data online.
