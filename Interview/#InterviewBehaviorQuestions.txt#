Where do you see yourself in 5yrs?
(2011-12-13) Honestly, I'm not sure where I'll be in 5 years. I'd love to be enjoying life doing the things I love. Maybe I'll be diong it for a paycheck and maybe I won't.  Maybe that means I'll still be working here, maybe not. I'm really enjoying writing software and learning all the myriad things that you can do with software. Maybe that'll change. I do enjoy the creative side of software and being able to create cool things. Maybe I'll have gotten curious about more hardware and moved on to doing hardware.  I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Maybe my interest in hardware and software will lead me to be a manager or technical lead of a group doing something in those areas. But do I have my sights set on *being* a manager or technical lead? No. I think I'll get there through my curiosity and love of what I do.
