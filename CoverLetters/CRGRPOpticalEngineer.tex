%PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).  
\noindent 
I am interested in the \position position posted on \jobpostingsource. 

%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details which bring your experiences to life. 
\noindent
I have 5 years of experience in electro-optic product development, integration, and testing.
At IBM and JDS Uniphase, I performed integration and qualification testing on gigabit ethernet and fibre-channel fiber optic transceivers.  I performed integration and qualification testing on both optical and electrical performance on both the transmit (EO) and receive (OE) ends. Integration duties involved finding ideal laser setpoints and signal shaping across operational temperature and voltage ranges. 
%Qualification testing involved performing a wide gamut of tests which included:optical center wavelength, electrical and optical rise and fall times, eye mask margin, stressed receiver sensitivity, optical extinction ratio, optical modulation amplitude
Qualification testing involved performing a wide gamut of tests across operational temperature, voltage and frequency ranges. In these roles I used digital communications analyzers, spectrum analyzers, pattern generators with software written in LabVIEW automating iterative aspects of the test procedure. Data was written to a database. I wrote software to query the database to automate analysis for report generation.
I have experience writing test software and data analysis tools in various programming languages. I have written tools in LabVIEW, C++, java, python, and php as well as interfacing with MySQL and SQLite databases.
%equipment I'm familiar and comfortable using, DCA, pattern gen, SPect analy, 
%hmm is it better to specify the tests etc taht I'm familiar with 
%signal shaping as in signal cleanup
%EO characterization test, matlab/labview automated test and data reporting/analysis, lasers, dataacquisition
%At IBM \& JDS Uniphase, I helped develop and modify LabVIEW code for integration and production testing.
%I've also implemented data logging to MySQL and SQLite databases and automatic graph generation for easy data analysis.

\noindent 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials. 
The \position sounds like a wonderful opportunity, and I would welcome the chance for an interview to discuss your needs and outline my strengths in person. 
You may reach me at \personalphonenumber or \personalemail.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my resume. I look forward to speaking with you.
 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
