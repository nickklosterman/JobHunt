\opening{Dear \contactperson ,} 

%PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).  
\noindent 
I am interested in the \position position posted on \jobpostingsource. 

%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details which bring your experiences to life. 
\noindent
I have extensive experience in setting up various Linux distributions on hardware as well as product testing and development of both hardware and software. 
I have extensive shell scripting experience using the bash shell. Scripts that I have written can be viewed online at http://www.github.com/nickklosterman/BashScripts. 
I am also versed in writing software in Java and C++ although more recently I have been writing software in Python due to the reduced development time. Recent projects can be viewed online at http://www.github.com/nickklosterman.
My work experience has given me an understanding of production test, development and debug. In my past engineering roles I have also used my software skills to automate data capture into MySQL databases for report generation of statistical data relevant to system performance.
My knowledge and use of linux, as well as the programming and scripting languages that mesh well with linux, provide me the appropriate tools to develop software for linux as well as automate their testing.
 
\noindent 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials. 
The \position sounds like a wonderful opportunity, and I would welcome the chance for an interview to discuss your needs and outline my strengths in person. 
You may reach me at \personalphonenumber or \personalemail.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my resume. I look forward to speaking with you.
 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
