\opening{Dear \contactperson ,} 

%PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).  
\noindent 
I am interested in the \position position posted on \jobpostingsource. 

%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details which bring your experiences to life. 
\noindent
I have extensive experience programming in a variety of languages with a recent focus on javascript.
At my current job I am converting C\# .NET software to web based software using javascript.
The software uses a MVVM design pattern which is similar to the MVC design pattern experience that is requested in the job description.
In this position I write javascript code as well as perform styling tasks for the web pages.
The job description states that you are looking for someone with experience writing Node applications. Although I do not write Node applications for my current job I use Node for several of my personal projects.  I have also taken a class taught by founders of startups in Cincinnati on Node.  As part of this class I wrote an API for updating system status on a web page.

 
\noindent 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials. 
The \position sounds like a wonderful opportunity, and I would welcome the chance for an interview to discuss your needs and outline my strengths in person. 
You may reach me at \personalphonenumber or \personalemail.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my resume. I look forward to speaking with you.
 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
