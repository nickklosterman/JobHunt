Dear Mr/Mrs.

I wanted to thank you for your time today. 

Intelligrated looks like a great company with an extremely bright future. I would love to make my contribution to growing the business as well as further developing my own skills. 


Dear Mr. Hanna,
I wanted to thank you for your time today. You truly sold me on Intelligrated as a great company with a solid product line and immense growth prospects.  I believe that joining your team of software developers would provide me with the growth and challenges that I'm looking for in a new career.
I'm encouraged by the direction your software group is going in developing its own modular 'LabVIEW' programming language to ease product development and customization.  Further, discussing things with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Roudabush, and Mr. Sprauer helped to give me a concrete idea of various areas where my software skills would have a great impact.

I appreciate the time you took to interview me and look forward to hearing from HR concerning the position.

Dear Mr. Johnson,
I wanted to thank you for your time today. Intelligrated sounds like a great company with an even brighter future. I believe that joining the software development team would provide me with the growth and challenges I'm looking for in a new career. The machine controls group sounds like a great group to develop my software skills while not totally abandoning the rest of my electrical engineering background.It would be too much of a shame to learning EE concepts to abandon them so quickly!

I appreciate the time you took to interview me and look forward to hearing from HR concerning the position.

I wanted to thank you for your time today. Intelligrated sounds like a great company with an even brighter future. The view of the production area provided me with a concrete grasp of the unique problems facing your quality group in its efforts to automate the software quality assurance process. I have some ideas and resources for you and your group regardless of whether or not I end up in your area.
 
I appreciate the time you took to interview me and look forward to hearing from HR concerning the position.

I believe that joining the software development team would provide me with the growth and challenges I'm looking for in a new career. The project delivery group and your goal of a single page interface using HTML5 & CSS sounds like a great project to grow my software skills and add to my repertoire of software competencies.

Dear Ms. Hawks,
I want to thank you for setting up my interviews with Mr. Hanna, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Roudabush, and Mr. Sprauer.  Each group presented me with its unique challenges and opportunities. I  honestly could see myself in any of the three groups. I voiced a preliminary ranking in my head to my contact at Aerotek on the way home from the interview. I am weighing the pros and cons of each area in my head as well as waiting for feedback from some colleagues on their thoughts.

Again, I appreciate you setting up my interviews and look forward to hearing back from you or Aerotek concerning the software engineer position.
I did accidentally walk out with my visitor badge. I doubt this is a problem but hopefully I'll be able to return it in the near future.
